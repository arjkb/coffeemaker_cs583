#### Setup Local Development

1. Clone this repo onto your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/arjunkrishnababu96/coffeemaker_cs583.git
```

2. Ensure that the default branch name is `develop`. Run `git branch` to confirm this.
```
 $ git branch
 * develop
```

You're all set to make changes to the code!


#### When you're ready to push
1. Make sure you're on the `develop` branch. If you worked on other branches for your local development, merge those branches into the `develop` branch.

2. Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from GitHub onto your local repo. This is so that you don't inadvertently overwrite the code on GitHub.
```
git pull
```
Fix merge conflicts if any.

3. Push to the `develop` branch.
```
git push -u origin develop
```
